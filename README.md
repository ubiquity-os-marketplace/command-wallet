# `@ubiquibot/command-wallet`

Allows users to register their wallets to collect rewards.

## Prerequisites

- A good understanding of how the [kernel](https://github.com/ubiquity/ubiquibot-kernel) works and how to interact with it.
- A basic understanding of the Ubiquibot configuration and how to define your plugin's settings.

## Getting Started

1. Install the dependencies preferably using `bun`.
2. Copy `.dev.vars.example` to `.dev.vars` and fill the variables
3. Generate Supabase types by running
   ```shell
   bun prebuild
   ```
4. Run the project with `bun wrangler`

## Example configuration

```yml
- plugin: https://ubiquibot-command-wallet.ubiquity.workers.dev
  id: command-wallet
  with:
    registerWalletWithVerification: false
```

###### At this stage, your plugin will fire on your defined events with the required settings passed in from the kernel. You can now start writing your plugin's logic.

5. Start building your plugin by adding your logic to the [plugin.ts](./src/plugin.ts) file.

## Testing a plugin

### Worker Plugins

- `yarn/bun worker` - to run the worker locally.
- To trigger the worker, `POST` requests to http://localhost:4000/ with an event payload similar to:

```ts
await fetch("http://localhost:4000/", {
  method: "POST",
  headers: {
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    stateId: "",
    eventName: "",
    eventPayload: "",
    settings: "",
    ref: "",
    authToken: "",
  }),
});
```

A full example can be found [here](https://github.com/ubiquibot/assistive-pricing/blob/623ea3f950f04842f2d003bda3fc7b7684e41378/tests/http/request.http).

### Action Plugins

- Ensure the kernel is running and listening for events.
- Fire an event in/to the repo where the kernel is installed. This can be done in a number of ways, the easiest being via the GitHub UI or using the GitHub API, such as posting a comment, opening an issue, etc in the org/repo where the kernel is installed.
- The kernel will process the event and dispatch it using the settings defined in your `.ubiquibot-config.yml`.
- The `compute.yml` workflow will run and execute your plugin's logic.
- You can view the logs in the Actions tab of your repo.

[Nektos Act](https://github.com/nektos/act) - a tool for running GitHub Actions locally.

- [Ubiquibot V1](https://github.com/ubiquity/ubiquibot) - helpful for porting V1 functionality to V2, helper/utility functions, types, etc. Everything is based on the V1 codebase but with a more modular approach. When using V1 code, keep in mind that most all code will need refactored to work with the new V2 architecture.
